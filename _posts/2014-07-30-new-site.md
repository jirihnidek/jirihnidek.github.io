title: New Site

This site is side effect of my experiment with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for one project I'm working on. Cool thing about GitHub pages is that you can create content of your page using [Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). The site is created from bootstrap theme called [Brushed](http://themes.alessioatzeni.com/html/brushed/). The complete page is assembled using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Of course git is used for uploading of the content.

## How to Reproduce This Shit?

If you will want to reproduce my pages, because you want to be inspired or steal my content ("Good artist copies."), then it is very easy. You have to have installed [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) in version 1.9.3 or higher and then type following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jirihnidek/jirihnidek.github.io.git
cd jirihnidek.github.io
bundle install
jekyll server --watch
```

Then open following link in your browser: http://localhost:4000 and you should see same content as you are looking at right now. When you will modify any markdown document in e.g. `_posts` and you will reload page, then Jekyll will automatically recreate page.
