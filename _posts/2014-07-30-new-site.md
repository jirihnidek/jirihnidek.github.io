This site is side effect of my experiments with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for one project I'm working on. Cool thing about GitHub pages is that you can create content of your page using [Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) upload it to the git repository and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) will assemble markdown documents to final static page. In this case the design of the site is created from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme called [Brushed](http://themes.alessioatzeni.com/html/brushed/).

## How to Reproduce This S..t?

If you will want to reproduce my pages, because you want to be inspired or steal my content ("Good artist copies."), then it is very easy. You have to have installed Linux/UNIX, git and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) in version 1.9.3 or higher and then type following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jirihnidek/jirihnidek.github.io.git
cd jirihnidek.github.io
bundle install
jekyll server --watch
```

After this open following link in your browser: http://localhost:4000 and you should see the same content as you are looking at right now. When you will modify any markdown document in e.g. *./_posts/* directory, then Jekyll will automatically recreate all modified pages.
